Odin Project Recipes Website Project
In this project I will build a very basic Recipes website using the HTML I learned in the first module of the Odin project.
When finished the website will stil be very basic, but I will come back to it during the CSS module to improve the aesthetics and usability. I assume I will similarly continue on this pattern with the JAVASCRIPT and ROR modules further down the line.
