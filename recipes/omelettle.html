<p>This omelette shown in season 2 of Hulu's TV show "The Bear" is a twist on the classic French Omelette</p>
<p>By whisking the eggs through a strainer, piping a log of Boursin cheese into the filling of the omelette, and crushing some chips over top, the classic dish is updated with a little modern flair and richness</p>
